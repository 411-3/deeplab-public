\section{Conclusions}

The paper has explored the use of weak or partial annotation
in training a state of art semantic image segmentation
model. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012
dataset have shown that: (1) Using weak annotation solely at the
image-level seems insufficient to train a high-quality segmentation
model. (2) Using weak bounding-box annotation in conjunction with
careful segmentation inference for images in the training set suffices
to train a competitive model. (3) Excellent performance is obtained when
combining a small number of pixel-level annotated images with a large
number of image-level annotated images in a semi-supervised setting,
nearly matching the results achieved when all training images have
pixel-level annotations. (4) Exploiting extra weak or strong
annotations from other datasets can lead to large improvements.
