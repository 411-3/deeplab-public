\begin{abstract}
Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained on a large number
of images with strong pixel-level annotations have recently
significantly pushed the state-of-art in semantic image
segmentation. We study the more challenging problem of learning DCNNs
for semantic image segmentation from either (1) weakly annotated
training data such as bounding boxes or image-level labels or (2) a
combination of few strongly labeled and many weakly labeled images. We
propose a modified EM algorithm featuring a censored E-step which 
takes into account the weak labels when inferring the latent training
image segmentations. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the
proposed system achieves state-of-art results on the challenging
PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.
