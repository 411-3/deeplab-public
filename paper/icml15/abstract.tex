\begin{abstract}
Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been recently shown to
significantly push the state-of-art in semantic image segmentation
when trained on a large number of images with strong pixel-level
annotations. We study the more challenging problems of learning DCNNs
for semantic image segmentation from either (1) weakly annotated
training data such as bounding boxes or image-level labels or (2) a
combination of few strongly labeled and many weakly labeled images. We
propose a modified EM algorithm featuring a censored E-step which
takes into account the weak labels when inferring the latent training
image segmentations. We show that the proposed system achieves
state-of-art results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image
segmentation benchmark.
