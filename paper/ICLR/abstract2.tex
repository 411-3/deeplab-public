\begin{abstract}
 Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have decisevely pushed the envelope of  high-level vision over the last couple of years, but their applications to low-level tasks are often not up the level of engineered computer vision systems. Our understanding is that this can be due to their increased invariance to local image transformations, and in this work we aim at  accommodating it in the context of semantic segmetnation.

Our main contribution consists in  increasing the spatial acuity of DCNNs  by combining their invariant classification results with bottom-up, image-driven cues for segmentation. 
In particular, we first demonstrate that simple modifications to the standard architectures used for object classification can deliver impessively accurate semantic segmentation results while operating at XXX frames-per-seconds. More importantly, we couple DCNNs  with Mean Field inference for Markov Random Fields  and obtain state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL semantic image segmentation task.
