\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Our work combines ideas from deep convolutional neural networks and
fully-connected conditional random fields, yielding a novel method able to
produce semantically accurate predictions and detailed segmentation maps,
while being computationally efficient. Our experimental results show that the
proposed method significantly advances the state-of-art in the challenging
PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation task.

There are multiple aspects in our model that we intend to refine, such as
fully integrating its two main components (CNN and CRF) and train the whole
system in an end-to-end fashion, similar to \citet{Koltun13, chen2014learning}.
We also plan to experiment with more datasets and apply our method to other 
sources of data such as depth maps or videos.

At a higher level, our work lies in the intersection of convolutional neural
networks and probabilistic graphical models. We plan to further investigate
the interplay of these two powerful classes of methods and explore their
synergistic potential for solving challenging computer vision tasks.
