While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have decisevely changed  high-level vision, their application to low-level tasks is still not as widespread. This can be partially attributed to their increased invariance to local image transformations, which results in excellent high-level classification but may inpair low-level tasks, such as semantic segmentation.
In this work we take a step in the direction of using DCNNs for semantic segmentation, and demonstrate that simple modifications to the standard architectures used for object classification can lead to excellent segmentation performance. More importantly, we couple DCNNs  with Markov Random Field inference and obtain state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL semantic image segmentation task.  We consider our main contribution to be the increase of the acuity of DCNNs, by combining invariant classifications with bottom-up, image-driven cues for segmentation.
